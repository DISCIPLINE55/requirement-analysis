# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to the study and practice of Requirement Analysis in Software Development. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured space to document, share, and explore requirement gathering techniques, analysis methods, and best practices that ensure software projects meet user needs and business objectives.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It involves understanding what users and clients want the software to achieve, the functionalities it should provide, and any constraints or limitations that must be considered.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

- **Foundation for Development:** Requirement analysis provides a clear roadmap for designers and developers, reducing ambiguity and minimizing errors.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensures that the software aligns with business goals and user expectations.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Identifying requirements early helps prevent costly changes and rework during later stages.
- **Quality Assurance:** Well-defined requirements make it easier to create test plans and validate that the final product meets expectations.
- **Risk Management:** Helps identify potential challenges and risks early, allowing for proactive mitigation strategies.
